# Making APIs Work for You

This is sample code from the webinar series **Making APIs Work For You** to show how you can leverage BlueCat Integrity&trade; API and develop solutions for software defined networking for Enterprise DNS, DHCP and IPAM services.

## Setup

Before using the code, you must download Python and your preferred Python IDE.

1. Install Python version 2.x or 3.x.
2. Install Python libraries: `pip install requests zeep`
3. Clone this repository with git: `git clone https://github.com/bluecatlabs/making-apis-work-for-you.git`

**NOTE: Episode 1 code uses Python suds library instead of zeep library for SOAP API examples. Episode 2 will show you how to convert code from suds to zeep on Episode 1.**

## Usage

Make sure to only use the code provided in a lab environment reserved for testing and learning purposes. You should change the scripts as per enterprise standards before adapting it for production use. Before executing the scripts, make sure to change the variables and URL for the BAM service to match your environment.

To execute the script, run `python 1-scriptname.py`
